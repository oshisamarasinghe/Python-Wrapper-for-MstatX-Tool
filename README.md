# Python-wrapper-for-Mstatx

This python wrapper is based on the MstatX project which was developed with the aim to provide an easy-to-use and easy-to-extend application to derive statistics from a multiple alignment file. This can be used to output a global score (mean score) for a multiple alignment. This wrapper is developed with the support of biopython library.

Initial credit of the application goes to Guillaume Collet( https://github.com/gcollet )

Prerequisites -
	Biopython Library, 
	Mstatx.exe (can be found in the source file)

Run example - python mstatx_test.py
